- `taxi_zone_lookup.csv`: A list of boroughs and zones

    - LocationID: A unique identifier for each location.
    - Borough: The borough in New York City where the location belongs (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.)
    - Zone: The specific zone within the borough.

### 2. Business Requirements
1. Real-time analysis: Analyze trip data in real-time to monitor trends and insights.
    - Detect trips with abnormal fees and durations.
    - Track the number of trips and the distribution of trips by borough in real-time.
    - Identify the most preferred payment methods and calculate the average revenue per hour.

2. Weekly Analysis: Generate comprehensive reports to uncover patterns and support strategic decisions.
    - Store complete data for batch processing and deeper analysis.
    - Compare trends across different weekdays to identify behavior patterns.
    - Analyze weekly performance metrics such as total revenue, trip volume, and preferred payment types.

#### Tech Selection

- `Kafka`: Kafka: A distributed event streaming platform designed to handle real-time data and support high-throughput, parallel processing.
- `Spark`: A distributed data processing engine that works seamlessly with Kafka. With **Spark Structured Streaming**, it enables near real-time data processing and real-time analytics. Spark is highly scalable and capable of handling large-scale data workloads.
- `PostgreSQL`: While not the best choice for handling large-scale or high-frequency real-time data due to its limitations in continuous writing and scalability, it's used in this experimental project for simplicity. Additionally, PostgreSQL integrates well with Power BI, which is used here for visualization.
- `PowerBI`: Used to build dashboards and visualize insights. It easily connects to PostgreSQL, making it convenient to create daily or weekly reports with minimal setup.
