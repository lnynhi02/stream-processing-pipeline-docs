The pipeline ingests data from a CSV source, processes it through a distributed streaming framework, and stores it in a structured database for analysis and visualization.</p> <p>     For a step-by-step deployment guide, visit the      Github repository. Happy coding! </p>"},{"location":"#system-architecture","title":"System Architecture","text":"<p>The pipeline begins by ingesting data from a CSV file into a Kafka topic, enabling real-time event streaming. Spark Streaming then consumes the data, performing necessary transformations and analyses before storing it in PostgreSQL. The processed data is subsequently used to build interactive dashboards in Power BI, allowing for both real-time monitoring and historical data analysis.</p>"},{"location":"#core-components","title":"Core Components","text":"<ul> <li>Kafka: Serves as a message broker, efficiently streaming data from CSV files into Kafka topics.</li> <li>Spark Streaming: Handles real-time data processing and transformation before storing results in PostgreSQL.</li> <li>PostgreSQL: Acts as the structured data storage for processed information, supporting analytical queries.</li> <li>Power BI: Provides interactive dashboards for real-time and historical data visualization.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#technical-decisions","title":"Technical Decisions","text":"<ul> <li>Kafka: Selected for its capability to handle high-throughput real-time data streaming.

By leveraging distributed computing, Spark efficiently processes large-scale streaming data with multiple executors and cores.</li> <li>PostgreSQL: Preferred over MySQL due to its superior analytical capabilities. While MySQL is optimized for high-speed writes, PostgreSQL is better suited for complex queries and analytical workloads.</li> <li>Power BI: Integrated seamlessly with PostgreSQL, making it an ideal choice for intuitive data visualization without requiring extensive additional configurations.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#technical-notes","title":"Technical Notes","text":""},{"location":"#optimizing-resource-allocation","title":"Optimizing Resource Allocation","text":"<ul> <li>Using a Single Executor: Due to limited CPU and memory resources, a fat executor approach is used\u2014allocating all available resources to a single executor.
